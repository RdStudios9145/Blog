Hello! Sorry for being a day late. I don't have much to say this week. Robotics takes a lot of time.

I've been planning to make a discord bot to send a message every time post something, im getting close but I don't know cloudflare workers that well. I was planning to have it done before I wrote this, but I did'nt feel like it.

I've been thinking a lot about Hyprland recently. I'm thinking of finishing my config and escaping GNOME. Im practically using GNOME like Hyperland, with the Pop!_OS tiling manager. It's just that GNOME has so much more polish than Hyprland stuff does, and it would take so much time to get it close enough.

I'll probably also make a new post _actually_ publicizing FoxLang too.

Anyway, that's kinda it. I'll probably update this when I finish the discord bot. Thanks, See ya!
