Hi! Im Lucy the Foxxo, welcome to the blog!

Im a high school student in the Silicon Vallaey in California. I would like to become more of a writer/blogger, so I'm planning to post once a week, probably on the weekends.

This blog will probably contain a variety of things:

 - Info about my programming projects (mostly this)
 - Some activism (especially after the election, also cars are bad)
 - Anything else I feel compelled to write about

So, welcome, and please enjoy your stay!
