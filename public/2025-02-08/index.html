		<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I would like to formally introduce FoxLang to the world! It&rsquo;s a programming language that I&rsquo;ve been working on during my spare time. It is very early in the development, but this has been what is consuming almost all of the time I spend programming, so I decided that it was fine to write about.</p>
<p>You can find the code <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here, on my github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have mostly finished the AST (with the exception of unnecessary things like structs), and I am going to start writing the interpreter part. Im planning to eventually make it compiled, with LLVM as the backend, but that is probably pretty far in the future.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that I am making my own language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>I saw a problem</em></strong>. Too many programmers are arguing about whether to use spaces or tabs for indentation, something that can easily be fixed by finding a specific character and completely designate it to indentation <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For this, I selected the fox emoji (it&rsquo;s called FoxLang, after all) ðŸ¦Š</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>It&rsquo;s what I do</em></strong>. The most interesting parts of programming are the ones that go deep (<em>hehe</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>). That&rsquo;s the same reason I tried making my own OS a while back. It&rsquo;s the reason I made my own package manager (with a friend). The most fun and interesting projects to make are the ones that are most fundamental to how we program. (I do not see myself writing my own emacs for a <em>very</em> long time).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Im planning to make it a mish-mash of a bunch of languages, including rust and c++. I&rsquo;ve also heard good things about C# and go, so I&rsquo;ll probably also look into those.</p>
<p>While you are here, please enjoy some (<em>very</em> subject to change) syntax snippets (also the first ever released to the public)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-fox" data-lang="fox">fn add(a int, b int) {
ðŸ¦ŠðŸ¦Šreturn a + b;
}

fn main() int {
ðŸ¦ŠðŸ¦Šlet out int = add(1, 2)
ðŸ¦ŠðŸ¦Šreturn add(out, 5) / 2;
}
